## OOP Fundamentals

		Class 	:: E.g class {Fruits } Objects { Apple, Banana }
		Objects	:: 
		Method 	:: Methods are functions that belongs to the class
				Two definition mthds
			    Inside class definition
			    Outside class definition

		Constructor || Destructor
				Is a special method that is automatically called when an object of a class is created

		Access Specifiers
				3 access specifiers
			    public - members are accessible from outside the class
			    private - members cannot be accessed (or viewed) from outside the class
			    protected - members cannot be accessed from outside the class, however, they can be accessed in inherited classes

		Exceptions
				try {
					  // Block of code to try
					  throw exception; // Throw an exception when a problem arise
					}
					catch () {
					  // Block of code to handle errors
					} 


		Pillars of OOPS
		---------------
			Inheritance
				Inheritance is the procedure in which one class inherits the attributes and methods of another class.

			Encapsulation
				The word, “encapsulate,” means to enclose something
				we encapsulate by binding the data and functions

			Polymorphism
				It describes the concept that you can access objects of different types through the same interface

			Abstraction
				Hiding the internal details or implementations of a function and showing its functionalities only
